			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>This website is dedicated to explaining and elucidating how I apply some of the great cello schools and methods in my own teaching.</p>
			<p>It is, needless to say, an ever-evolving task. Really, the fruit of an endless quest and an insatiable curiosity about helping students to understand and apply the skills and artistry needed to develop as a person, artist, musician, and cellist.</p>

				 	<h1>Suzuki</h1>
					<p>Suzuki is about as close to a household name as one gets in the world of string teaching and with good reason. The Suzuki method has proven to be an extremely succesful way of nurturing young children through the lens of instrumental music.</p>
					<p>A cornerstone of the Suzuki is the "mother-tongue" approach. Suzuki intuitively understood that young children could learn to play an instrument in the same way they acquire their native language, through hearing and repetition in the warm, loving environment provided by family.</p>
					<p>Many of Suzuki's intuitions were correct and have since been validated through more rigorous scientfic studies</p>
					<p>The usual criticisms of Suzuki include the notion that reading and note recognition are delayed etc. </p>

					<h2>Suzuki and the Cello</h2>
					<p>In the case of the cello specifically, there are a few key drawbacks</p>
					<li>
						<ul><strong>Starting on 4 instead of 3:</strong> the Suzuki Cello method is a straight transoposition of the violin method. On the violin the child learns to use third finger first (i.e. the ring finger). The use of the third finger leads to the most balanced position for the hand and this is a great way to start. With the cello, however, three becomes four. Four leads to a trickier hand balance that is not ideal for the beginner. </ul>
						<ul>Starting with a descending scale pattern</ul>
					</li>

			<h1>Sassmannshaus</h1>
			<p>While not a household name (at least in the United States) for string teaching, the Sassmannshaus family has made a tremendous contribution to the field of string pedagogy with their violin, and now, cello method for early learners.</p>
			<p>Sassmannshaus offers some key differences to Suzuki that I find to be highly complementary, including the introduction of note-reading right away, starting on the cello with third finger, making use of all four strings from the beginning, and excellent excersizes to develop the basic detache stroke and use of the whole bow.</p>
